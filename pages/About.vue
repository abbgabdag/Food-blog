                I have always loved food. From a young age have i had a interest for food, I loved tasting food and experimenting with food. I would always ask my mother questions about the food she would make for us. I come from a middle eastern background where food is a major part of our tradition and culture so it was only natural for me to have a passion for food. I started cooking around the age of 8-9 with helping my mother in the kitchen and just started to ask questions about the seasonings she used to create extraordinary flavours in the food. I used to bake a lot of chocolate muffins and started to experiment more and more with different recipes

            Today I have been cooking for almost 8 years. I have definitely learned a lot over the years and my cooking skills have developed tremedously. I have been cooking food, watching food, asking about food, tasting food and all of the above. Today I am very confident in my ability to cook and try more often now to not use recipies. I love food from all around the world. I love trying new foods in different cultures and experimenting with making their foods. My passion for food has only grown to become larger and even deeper than before. Some of my favourite food cultures are indian, middle eastern and mexican.

            My future plans for my food passion is almost endless. I have so many dreams and goals that I want to accomplish. In the near future I want to possible go and compete in masterchef and taking my cooking skills to the next level. I want to develop my cooking skills further and want to get feedback from the best chefs out their. Gordan Ramsy is one of my chef idols and he has taught me a lot about food, the delicacy and the many different flavours food can have. I would also like to open my own restaurant one day and reach a michelin star and have Gordon come eat at my restaurant.
