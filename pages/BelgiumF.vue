        Belgian food history
    </div>

    <div id="Sub1">
        Belgian cuisine has been developing under the influence of very different traditions. In the old times, here was a mixture of the Celtic and Roman cuisine traditions, which was supplemented by the Germanic people and later affected by the Burgundian, Spanish, Austrian and French cuisine traditions. Because of permanent disunity into separate feudal nations, Belgium is notable for its regional variety. Each region has its own types of cheese and beer, its own traditional cookies. Quite often the name of a dish has a link to a geographical region. The most important regional cuisine traditions are the Flemish (northwest Belgium), brabantian (central Belgium), Liege (eastern Belgium), Ardennian (southeast Belgium) and some others.

        Belgium is considered the country of gourmets. Great food and special-tasting beer is an important part of the Belgian culture. It is said that Belgian food is a combination of French quality and German sizes of portions. Belgium has very rich beer traditions. Beer was first made by monks trappists in the middle ages. Nowadays, beer made in monasteries is considered to be the best and the most prestigious. Currently, there are 125 beer factories in Belgium, which brew 800 types of beer. Beer is poured into specific bottles and has specific mugs. The variety of hot dishes is huge. In the process of preparing food, different types of meat and fish are used; but unlike in southern regions, beer is used for stewing, not wine. In seaside regions, fish and mollusks are popular.  The national Belgian dish is moules frites – fried potatoes with fresh mussels, which are served in many different ways. It is a real delicacy, which is to be enjoyed after putting all of the worries away.

        The Belgians are real experts at preparing waffles. They are the most important Belgian desserts with a long history. There are two types of waffles. Liege waffles are hard, round and have pieces of caramel inside. Brussels waffles are soft and fluffy, served warm, with whipped cream and fruit. Belgian chocolate is also famous. The tradition of drinking cacao came here in the 16th century, but only in the middle of the 19th century chocolate in Belgium started to be used as a dessert, not as medicine.  While developing the industry of sweet chocolate, candies with filling (chocolate praline) were invented. You won’t find such masterpieces of nuts, caramel and chocolate elsewhere but in Belgian confectioneries.
