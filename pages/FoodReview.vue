                    The first review is on birria tacos. If you have not heard of it before, it is a mexican dish that consists of a taco where you put some meat that has been slow cooked for 4 hours and then top that with cheese and fold it and then cook it. Then you have a consum√© to dip the taco in. When I first made it i did not have all the proper ingredients but they still turned out amazing. I made it once more but this time with the proper ingridients and it turned out so much better. It has such deep and rich flavours from the fatty beef as well as the flavour pouch used to cook the meat in. If you like spicy and sweet foods that is a bit messy, I would highly recommend the dish. 5  out of 5   stars

                    The second review is on some amazing blueberry brownies. These are not your average brownies. These blueberry brownies have the perfect balance between sweetness and savoryness. The blueberries inside complement the fudgy chocolate bits which gives every bite a burst of blueberry as well as a gooey chocolate bit to go with it. This recipe is also incredibly simple to make and it does not take much effort, so if your are a lazy person this is perfect for you. While this blueberry brownie might seem very heavy and dense it is suprisingly very light and fluffy. This is a great thing since you can eat many brownies without feeling guilty or super full. These brownies also go very well with a nice cup of coffe. The recipe for these are on my blog as well under recipies 5 out of 5 stars

                    My final review is on the absolut delicious butter chicken with garlic naan bread. I cannot express myself how good this food is. The chicken is perfect cooked and tender due to it being marinaded over 24 hours. The flavours of the spices penetrate the chicken during that process and turn out just perfect. The garlic naan bread is also on a whole different level. It is so fluffy and light and once you start eating it you just can't stop, it is that good. Even the sauce is immaculate and on its own is amazingly good. When you combine the sauce with the chicken and eat it with the bread the flavours become intense and crazy good. The flavours would just melt on your tongue and after that first bite you will only go back for more and keep that up until you've finished it all and wished you had made more. This is a highly recommended recipe you should try or even go out and eat it at an authentic Indian restaurant. 10 out of 5 stars!
