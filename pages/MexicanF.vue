          Mexican food history
      </div>

      <div id="Mex1">
          he basics of Mexican cuisine can be traced back to 7000 BCE, when Mexico and Central America had yet to be colonized. Back then indigenous people roamed the area and survived by hunting animals and gathering plants. One of the most common plants in the area was the wild chile pepper, which they ate frequently. Corn first entered their diet 500 years later in 1200 BCE. It was domesticated through a system called Nixtamalization where the corn would be treated with lye to soften it for grinding. Nixtamalization lead to the use of tortillas and other types of corn based breads. The indigenous people had a very hard time collecting sufficient protein, as meat was scare around the area. To try to make up for this they ate a lot of beans, which would be served as a side of most meals with corn.

        As is the case with many countries in today's world, Mexico was created through colonization, in this case from the Spanish. The Spanish introduced many of their own recipes and dishes into the indigenous culture, like rice, olive oil, garlic, coriander, cinnamon, and many other spices. They also brought many domesticated animals like pigs, sheep, cows, chickens, goats, and more for a reliable source of protein. The cows, goats, and sheep were used for dairy as well, with cheese becoming a main ingredient in many dishes.

        Today Mexican Cuisine is a nice blend of the indigenous and Spanish cuisine. It is still based in beans, corn, tortillas, and chile peppers, but these are now usually served with some sort of meat and cheese. Most dishes come with some sort of rice and spices as well, a clear nod to the European influence. Since the colonization many cuisines have influenced Mexican Food, including French. The French intervened in Mexico in the 19th century, and their food was enjoyed by the upper class even after they left.
