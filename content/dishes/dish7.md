            <li>1. Cut the beef into slices 5cm long and 5mm thick, cutting against the grain of the meat. Put them in a bowl. Mix in the soy sauce, sesame oil, rice wine or Sherry and cornflour. Leave to marinate for 20 mins.</li> <br>
            <li>2. Heat a wok until it is very hot, then add the groundnut oil. When it is slightly smoking, add the beef slices and stir-fry for 5 mins or until lightly browned. Remove the meat from the wok and drain well in a colander set inside a bowl. Discard the drained oil.</li> <br>
            <li>3. Wipe the wok clean and reheat it over a high heat. Add the peppers, and cook for 3-4 mins or until softened. Add the oyster sauce and bring it to a simmer. Return the drained beef slices to the wok and toss them thoroughly with the oyster sauce. Turn the mixture on to a serving platter, top with the spring onions and serve immediately.</li> <br>
